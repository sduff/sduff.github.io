# About Simon Duff

Simon was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia. He now spend much of his time
traveling between various Australian cities for work, and Singapore, to spend
time with his wife and children.

He is a Professional Services Consultant for a leading Big-Data company, which
allows him to work with many large enterprises. Each client has their own unique
set of use-cases and challenges, which provides ample room for creative and
practical solutions.

Simon was inspired to start blogging about his work as an aid to help demystify
big-data, both in terms of its capabilities and limitations.

was pursuing research in Artificial Intelligence, leading to him obtaining
a Masters in Applied Science. You can read more about this research at /ai](ai).
