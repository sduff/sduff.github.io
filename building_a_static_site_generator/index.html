There are hundreds of static site generators https://jamstack.org/generators/ available. Enough already.

However, so many developers will often be lured by the siren call to write their own custom static site generator. Its either some feature that their current SSG misses, they find it too complex to tweak an SSG to create the output they want, or they just think they can do better than what is already out there.

However, it is not as straight forward as one might seem.

In all honesty, writing your own static site generator is a waste of time -- hence why I dubbed my own static site generator `waste`.

Countless revisions and updates, I confess I have spent more time writing and rewriting this generator than I have writing interesting articles.

This article aims to address
