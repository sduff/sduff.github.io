# Splunk

I've been using Splunk for almost 10 years, after first being introduced to it
as a Security tool while I was working at a major Australian bank. So impressed
with the product, I joined the company, and have been a Professional Services
consultant with them ever since.

## What the Splunk?


*We Make Machine Data Accessible, Usable and Valuable to Everyone*
{: style="text-align: center"}

Splunk provides a mechanism for the collection of machine data information and
events, with a robust storage and analysis engine. Sitting on top of this is
a web front end that allows rapid exploration and development of dashboards and
alerts. The whole framework allows easy integration of 
[machine learning](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2890/), 
[custom visualisations](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/AdvancedDev/CustomVizDevOverview) and 
[automated responses](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/solutions/solution-areas/security-and-fraud/adaptive-response-initiative.html).

We also have the [best T-shirts](https://www.co-store.com/splunk) ðŸ˜‰
