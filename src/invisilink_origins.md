# Historical

It turns out, I wasn't the first to combine memory and four-in-a-row. In 1989,
Parker Brothers released ["In The
Dark"](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4133/dark), which involved a hidden
four-in-a-row field. When one player believed they had won, the markers were
revealed to show if they were correct or not. In 1992, a German publisher
Piatnik released "4 Versteckt" which had the same premise.
